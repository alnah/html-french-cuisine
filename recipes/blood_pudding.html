<p>It's the deep, dark blood.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pig's blood.</li>
  <li>Pork fat. Greasy, slippery.</li>
  <li>Onions, finely chopped. They sting your eyes.</li>
  <li>Stale bread or breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recipes instructions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Start with the onions, frying them until they're translucent.</li>
  <li>Mix the blood, the pork fat, and those onions in a bowl.</li>
  <li>Throw in the breadcrumbs or stale bread. They'll soak up the blood.</li>
  <li>Shape them into whatever form feels right. Cook them until they're done, but not too done. There's a fine line between perfection and disaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blood Pudding. Pour yourself a drink, eat, and reflect.</p>
