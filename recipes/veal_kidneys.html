<p>A complex and profound dish.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A pair of veal kidneys.</li>
  <li>A good glug of brandy or cognac.</li>
  <li>Onions, imperfectly chopped.</li>
  <li>Butter, rich and melting.</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
  <li>A dash of mustard or cream.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recipes instructions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Clean those kidneys up. Remove the white, sinewy bits.</li>
  <li>In a hot skillet, throw in that butter and let it sizzle. Add the onions, letting them sweat. Let them sear, getting a good char.</li>
  <li>Here's where the magic happens. Pour in that brandy or cognac. Light it up! Watch it flame.</li>
  <li>Once the alcohol's burned off and you've had your show, season it well. If you're in the mood, stir in some mustard or cream. Mix until it all comes together.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it. "Rognons de veau," or veal kidneys.</p>
