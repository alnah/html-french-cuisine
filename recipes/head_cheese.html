<img src="./images/head_cheese.png" alt="French Head Cheese">
<p>It's not cheese. It's the scraps, the leftovers, the parts nobody else wants.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>One pig's head. Cut it in half. Get to know it.</li>
  <li>Pig's tongue. Optional.</li>
  <li>A couple of onions. The cheaper, the better.</li>
  <li>Carrots? Sure, why not.</li>
  <li>2 cloves of garlic. Crushed.</li>
  <li>Bay leaves. Two of them.</li>
  <li>Some mix of herbs. Like a bouquet.</li>
  <li>10 peppercorns. Black, round, and bitter.</li>
  <li>Cloves, 6. The spice, not the cigarette.</li>
  <li>Salt, for all those wounds. 15 grams per liter.</li>
  <li>Gelatine. If you can't wait for the real thing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recipes instructions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Throw that pig's head in water. Watch it boil, bubbles rising.</li>
  <li>In goes everything else. The onions, the carrots. Let it simmer. Slow.</li>
  <li>When it's all soft and falling apart, pull it out. Slice it up. Pour the leftover liquid. It's all a mess, but it's your mess.</li>
  <li>Cool it down. Slice it up. Drink a beer, or a whiskey, or both. Eat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Head Cheese. Hell, you make do with what you got.</p>
